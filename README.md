# JavaScript Search Suggestions

This JavaScript code provides a search suggestion feature for a search input on a web page. Users can type in the search box, and a list of suggestions will be displayed based on their input. They can navigate through the suggestions using the arrow keys or mouse hover and select a suggestion by pressing Enter. The suggestions are dynamically loaded from a predefined list of phrases.

## Usage

To use this JavaScript code in your project:

1. Copy the `search.js` file into your project directory.
2. Link the `search.js` file in your HTML file.
3. Create an HTML element for the search input and a container for the suggestions list.
4. Add event listeners for keyup events on the search input and click events on the document to handle suggestion selection and closing.
5. Style the suggestions list as desired using CSS.
